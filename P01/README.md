Project description:

When you have been a child, you might have a piggy bank, jar, or some other moneybox to
hold your spare coins. In this first programming assignment, we are going to implement a piggy
bank which holds US currency coins. This piggy bank is a kind of bag that holds your coins
but with no organization. It can also contain duplicate coins. This application defines mainly
the following operations.
 You can add a coin to the piggy bank.
 You can get the balance of your piggy bank.
 You can remove an arbitrary coin from the piggy bank (in real life scenario, you can shake
the bank, so you have no control over what coin falls out).
 You can remove coins with respect to a requested amount of money.
 You can remove all coins from your piggy bank.
