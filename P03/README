Overview and Learning Objectives:
Frequently the provided objects and data types in Java are insufficient for the specific needs of a
program, and it can simplify your life significantly to create a custom data type tailored exactly to your
needs. This write-up may be more succinct than usual, as you have already thought about most of this
problem already when you solved it with arrays.
This time, you'll be coding up an expandable Piggy Bank (though not infinitely expandable) with much of
the same functionality as your first programming assignment.
